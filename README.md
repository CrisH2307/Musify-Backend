** Assignment 3 (Due on Feb 25, 2023; 10pm) **

All these questions require you to implement a client & server architecture in Python.

Start with the basic implementation of a client and a server.

Find out a library in Python which you can use for pickling. In a separate file, try using the library to pickle a file.

Once you are successfully able to pickle a file, call that function inside your server class whenever you need to pickle an object

The intention of this activity is to practice these two skills

How to implement a client server architecture in Python and serialize the data during communication
How to organize your code to not have repetitive code
Once you are done, make sure to refcator your code to implement all the reusable components as separate modules and import wherever necessary. You can create new files/modules to arrange your reusable code.
